    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rayleenlewis/Desktop/MADA-Mac-local/rayleenlewis-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I will first choose some fun colors for each Emphasis. I will use the ggplot2 package to create this boxplot (specifying geom as geom_boxplot). Using the labs() function, I will rename the axis labels and the title of the boxplot. Then using scale_fill_manual(), I will incorporate the colors I chose earlier. With scale_y_continuous(), I will widen the scope of the y axis. Using theme(), I will put the legend at the bottom and make the axes and title bold and larger in size (as well as center the title). I will save this boxplot as “exercise2-boxplot.png”\n\ncustom_colors_boxplot &lt;- c(\"Biostat\" = \"#9eadee\", \"DAM\" = \"#9eebee\", \"Epi\" = \"#9eeea4\")\n  \nplot_boxplot &lt;- ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = Emphasis, y = Height, fill = Emphasis)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Emphasis\", y = \"Height (in cm) \", title = \"Height by Emphasis in PhD Program\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors_boxplot) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(120, 200)) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"))\n\nexercise2_boxplot = here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"results\",\"figures\",\"exercise2-boxplot.png\")\nggsave(filename = exercise2_boxplot, plot= plot_boxplot) \n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nInterpretation: From the boxplot above, it appears as though the students in the Biostat Emphasis have the highest average height and have the greatest variation in height.\nI will create a scatterplot with Weight on the X axis and GPA on the Y axis. I will use the ggplot2 package to create this scatterplot (specifying geom as geom_point). Under geom_point(), I will add a color for the points to be and I will increase their size for visibility. Using the labs() function, I will rename the axis labels and the title of the boxplot. Using theme(), I will put the legend at the bottom and make the axes and title bold and larger in size (as well as center the title). I will save this boxplot as “exercise2-scatterplot.png”\n\nplot_scatterplot &lt;- ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = Weight, y = GPA)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#9eadee\", size = 2.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of GPA against Weight \", x = \"Weight (in kg)\", y = \"GPA\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")) \n\nexercise2_scatterplot = here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"results\",\"figures\",\"exercise2-scatterplot.png\")\nggsave(filename = exercise2_scatterplot, plot= plot_scatterplot) \n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nInterpretation: It appears as though there is no true correlation between Weight and GPA as the points are all relatively spread out. There is a minimal amount of clustering in the upper left corner, however this likely isn’t significant (considering the sample size is n = 9).\nI will not run any statistical tests to assess the correlation coefficient since this was not stated as part of the instructions.\n\n\nNotes\nFor your own explorations, tables and figures can be “quick and dirty”. As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

For example, I may see a table in a paper that I would like to convert to a figure for a presentation. I decided to spend this week’s module trying to find tools that could convert a PDF or image into usable data.\nAs a learning example, I found a table online showing the Dallas Cowboys’ week 18 injury report. This table was small enough that it felt like a manageable test project, because you can see the effects of each step of processing.\n\nThis was also interesting to me personally because throughout the season, it felt like the Cowboys had many players in the same position get hurt.

    "text": "UGA is my final stop through the largest 3 institutes/universities in Georgia.\nI earned my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a psychology minor from Georgia Tech. My research focused on deep brain stimulation, which has proven effective as treatment for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and Parkinson’s disease.\nNext, I earned my MPH with a concentration in Biostatistics from Georgia State University, where I researched posttraumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents following natural disasters.\nThrough connections I made at Georgia State, I landed a position as an epidemiologist at the CDC studying human papillomavirus (HPV) in August 2016, which was a big pivot from my focus in mental health, but I found I love studying infectious diseases more. Eight and a half years later, I’m still on the same great team doing really cool research on the impact and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine and the epidemiology of HPV and HPV-attributable diseases.\nDespite already having a job I love, I made the somewhat ridiculous decision to pursue a PhD and started at UGA Fall 2022. I’m a 3rd year part-time student on the Data Analysis and Modeling track, and I’m very happy to report that I’m in my last semester of classes and hope to graduate Fall 2025 (the more people I tell this timeline to, the more accountable I’ll be to actually hit it…).\n\n\n\nI’ve had a lot of opportunities to work with different types of data through my job. I’ve spent many years working with NHANES data, which is complex survey data. I’ve also worked with insurance claims databases (i.e., MarketScan), multi-site surveillance projects, single site research studies, and I’ve contributed to a couple of systematic reviews (although I hope to retire without every working on another of these). I primarily work with binary outcomes (HPV positive/negative), but I’m expanding to quantitative assessments of HPV antibody concentrations through my dissertation work. I work almost exclusively in SAS and SUDAAN (a SAS-callable language for complex survey analyses). I’ve done coursework in R, but it is not my preferred language.\nAnalytic techniques I’ve used professionally include complex survey analysis, generalized linear models, and JoinPoint regression (aka segmented linear regression). As part of coursework, I’ve used structural equation modeling, finite mixture modeling, classfication techniques, and other multivariate methods. For anyone looking for an interesting, approachable, quantitative course, I cannot recommend Dr. Shiyu Wang’s Multivariate Methods course (ERSH 8350) in the Department of Education enough!\n\n\n\nOutside of work and school, my favorite hobby is bouldering (rock climbing short walls without ropes). Running is my favorite stress-reliever, even though I’m not very good at it. I did finish my second Triple Peach this year, which is a three race series that finishes with a half marathon on Thanksgiving. Any other free time is spent playing board games or going to Atlanta United soccer games, Georgia Tech football games, and plays at the Fox Theater.\nRelated to my love of board games, during my first semester at UGA, I took Amy Winter’s Intro to R course. For my final project, I chose to use publicly available data on board games to determine if cooperative board games had a higher average rating than competitive games. Spoiler, they don’t, but I think that’s likely due to selection bias since the serious board game fanatics are more likely rate games online than casual players. But, I found my data on Kaggle, which has tons of free datasets for anyone in need of data for class projects.\nOne of my 2024 highlights was attending the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit after winning an “Enter for a chance to win” package. Apparently those things really do give out prizes!"

And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rayleenlewis/Desktop/MADA-Mac-local/rayleenlewis-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nSide note: the only thing changed in the code chunk above was “processeddata.rds” being changed to “processeddata2.rds” (as per the instructions on the course website).\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
